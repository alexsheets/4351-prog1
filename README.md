- in third section of Tiger.lex:
    - bulk of code will go here
    - code in form of a reg ex., followed by Java code in curly braces.
    - could add other regular expressions for other tokens we have
    - repeat the lines there for all special characters as well as all keyboards
    - gets more complicated with identifiers or other stuff, like comments, etc.
- YY-initial:
    - JLex recognizes each token in one piece.
    - for comments/strings, recognize them in multiple pieces; will need %STATE declarations
    - <YYINITIAL>

- to run the analyzer, I believe we need to do what make does; so run if that works, if not, type out the second command (java JLex.Main Tiger.lex)
- then use cat > test.tig, or name it whatever, write some stuff
- then use java Parse.Main test.tig

- need to work on:
    - escape sequences (ignore state I think)
        - \n = end-of-line [Done? More Tests]
        - \t = Tab [Done? More Tests]
        - \^c = Control Characters [Done? More Tests]
            - \^? gives illegal control character in reference; Backspaces in our implementation
        - \ddd = Character with ASCII code ddd 0-255 [begun but definitely not working, also no error handling yet; Line 121]
        - \" = Double quote [Done? More Tests]
        - \\ = Backslash character [Done? More Tests]
        - \f___f\ = f___f is formatting characters, ignore [not attempted, kinda scared]
        - Backslashes are also escape characters in reg ex, must escape in tiger.lex
    - comments? [Done? More Tests]
    - strings [Done after Escape? More Tests]
